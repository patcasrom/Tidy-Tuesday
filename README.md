# Tidy-Tuesday

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly project that builds off #makeovermonday style projects using the R programming language. The emphasis is on using data wrangling/munging techniques using R to prepare the data to be analyzed and create meaningful visualizations.
The most common packages I use to participate in this weekly community project are tidyr for data cleaning, dplyr for data manipulation, and ggplot2 for data visualization, among other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.
